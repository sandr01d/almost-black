## Credits

The Konsole theme is based on Dark+ from [iTerm2-Color-Schemes](https://github.com/mbadolato/iTerm2-Color-Schemes).  
The splash screen was forked from  P3tray's [1604-Arch-Splash](https://github.com/P3tray/1604-Arch-Splash).  
The ASCII art in the screenshot of console was created using [this](https://paste.xinu.at/oeP93l/plain) script from lolilolicon.  
The icon theme I use in the screenshots is the wonderful [Papirus Dark](https://github.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/papirus-icon-theme/).
